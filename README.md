## Inspiration
Inspired by my friend's little brother. While video calling my friend one day, his little brother came into his room for help with his chemistry homework. He was having trouble visualizing the 3D molecular shapes. During COVID-19, he did not have the usual physical 3D models to play with. Thus, I decided to make 3D models through software to help him.
